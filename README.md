<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run Troy you first need to build the application.
```console
lenra build
```

Then you can start it.
```console
lenra start
```

You can then access the application by opening [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) on your web browser. 

In this application, you will find categories and tries. 
You can think of categories as ideas of cooking recipes and tries as trying different quantities for the contents of the recipe.

Let's admit that you want to cook something new, you start by creating the category "My New Recipe" and add some fields which are the ingredients of your recipe. Then you create a new try and fill the values for each ingredient.
